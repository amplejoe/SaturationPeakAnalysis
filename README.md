# SaturationPeakAnalysis
This archive contains the Python implementation of the custom made smoke detection
algorithms SAN and SPA, described in <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=3126686.3126690" target="_blank">[1]</a>. The files should be self explanatory
and simply demonstrate the classification output of a desired input image with
optional histogram output.

Requirements:

- Python 2.7+   (packages: numpy)
- OpenCV        (Configured to work with Python)
